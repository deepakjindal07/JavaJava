Interfaces: Understanding the core interfaces of the Collections Framework such as Collection, List, Set, and Map, and their respective subtypes.
Implementations: Knowing the various implementations of the collection interfaces provided by the Java Collections Framework, like ArrayList, LinkedList, HashSet, TreeSet, HashMap, and TreeMap, among others.
Iterators: Learning about iterators and how they are used to traverse collections. The Iterator interface provides methods for iterating over elements in a collection in a consistent and efficient manner.
Generics: Understanding how generics are used throughout the Collections Framework to provide type safety and flexibility. Generics allow you to specify the type of elements that a collection can contain.
Sorting and Searching: Exploring algorithms and methods for sorting and searching elements within collections. The Collections utility class provides methods for sorting lists and performing binary searches.
Concurrency: Understanding the thread-safety aspects of collections, especially in concurrent programming scenarios. Java provides synchronized and concurrent collections like ConcurrentHashMap, CopyOnWriteArrayList, and ConcurrentLinkedQueue for use in concurrent environments.
Performance Characteristics: Knowing the performance characteristics of different collection implementations, including time complexities for various operations such as insertion, deletion, and retrieval.
Common Operations: Mastering common operations performed on collections, such as adding, removing, updating, and querying elements.
Comparators and Comparable: Understanding the Comparator and Comparable interfaces for defining custom ordering of elements in collections.
Stream API: Exploring the Stream API introduced in Java 8, which provides a powerful way to process collections using functional-style operations like map, filter, reduce, and collect.
Bulk Operations: Learning about bulk operations provided by the Collections utility class, such as addAll, removeAll, retainAll, and replaceAll.
Memory Considerations: Understanding memory usage and considerations when working with large collections, including strategies for minimizing memory footprint and avoiding memory leaks.
